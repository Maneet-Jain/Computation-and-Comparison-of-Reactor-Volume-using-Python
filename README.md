# Computation-and-Comparison-of-Reactor-Volume-using-Python
## TOPIC: 
To develop a python code to calculate reactor volume, and suggest which reactor to choose for a particular operation.
## OBJECTIVES:
To take required information to calculate volume of Batch, CSTR, PFR reactors or PFR + CSTR and CSTR + PFR reactors in series and suggest the best solution for a certain reaction.
## DETAILS:
1. Taking kinetic data and initial concentrations as an input and calculate the volume for different reactors (Batch, CSTR, PFR reactors or PFR + CSTR and CSTR + PFR reactors in series), and the program will be able to tell us which reactor is best suited (Minimum volume) for a certain kinetics.
2. I have chosen first order kinetics to simplify the calculations.
3. The code will run for all the different reactors and calculate the volume and decide the most suitable reactor.
