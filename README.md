# Computation-and-Comparison-of-Reactor-Volume-using-Python
## TOPIC: 
To develop a python code to calculate reactor volume, and suggest which reactor to choose for a particular operation.
## OBJECTIVES:
To take required information to calculate volume of Batch, CSTR, PFR reactors or PFR + CSTR and CSTR + PFR reactors in series and suggest the best solution for a certain reaction.
## DETAILS:
The code has to be developed in such a way that you take kinetic data and initial concentrations as an input and calculate the volume for different reactors (Batch, CSTR, PFR reactors or PFR + CSTR and CSTR + PFR reactors in series), and the program should be able to tell you which reactor is best suited (Minimum volume) for a certain kinetics. You may choose to simplify on the kinetics of the system (keeping it first order)
